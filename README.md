## 📝 Overview

<div align="justify">

This repository hosts the source code of my personal portfolio website, a digital showcase of my professional journey, technical skills, and project work across domains like cloud computing, data science, machine learning, and distributed systems.

The website serves as a one-stop platform for recruiters, collaborators, and fellow developers to learn more about me, explore my project portfolio and get in touch. Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, it reflects both my technical proficiency and attention to clean, responsive design.
